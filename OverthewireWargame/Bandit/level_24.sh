# A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

# NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

# NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy aroundâ€¦
